## Web Application UserEnum
### Tool Overview
UserEnum makes multiple login attempts with a known bad username followed by multiple login attempts with a a list of usernames. Some web applications check for the presence of a user account before checking the password. This leads to a noticeable time delta between attempts with a good username verses a bad username.

### Project Code
